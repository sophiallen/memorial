        <h2>What did your grandmother tell you?</h2>
        <p>One summer, while teaching me to quilt, Gramma noticed that I kept tangling my thread. So she told me a story from early in her nursing career. </p>
        <p>Fresh out of nursing school, she had been preparing surgical supplies (needle, thread, guaze, etc) and decided that it was better to have too much thread than too little.
        The surgeon, however, took one look at the thread and asked her: "What did your grandmother tell you about measuring thread?" </p>
        <p>She was embarassed, but realized he was right. Long strands seem efficient, but they cause endless tangles and knots. It's a small thing, but I love thinking about the generations of grandmothers whose advice continues on in the hands of surgeons and seamstresses alike.</p>

        <h2>Julia's Bustin' Out</h2>
        <p>According to grandma, the uniforms given to navy nurses were very fashionable but also deliberately loose so as to conceal distracting bustlines. However, on certain women (grandma included) the extra roomy top served to emphasize their curves rather than hide them. The sailors in her ward were very appreciative of this fact, and even sang a short riff on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I-790dGx-o">show tune</a> when they saw her walk in: <em>"Ju-lia's bustin' out all ooooverrrr~!"</em></p>

        <h2>My Gramma</h2>
        <p> She could find the missed stitch and fix it without making you feel foolish. She could make the act of waving goodbye hilarious and regal at the same time. She tamed the most frightened of feral animals, diagnosed upset stomachs from hundreds of miles away, and made any day feel like a birthday by virtue of a chocolate cake. </p>
        <p>She rescued me, and a garden snake, with a pair of hot-dog tongs. Her house always smelled faintly of lemons, beach towels, and small beloved animals. She didn't mind if I played chopsticks on her piano.</p>
        <p> She made small blue pebbles seem rare and precious, for the simple reason that <em>I</em> had picked them out, just for her.</p>
