        <h2>What did your grandmother tell you?</h2>
        <p>One summer, while teaching me to quilt, Gramma noticed that I kept tangling my thread. So she told me a story from early in her nursing career. </p>
        <p>Fresh out of nursing school, she had been preparing surgical supplies (needle, thread, guaze, etc) and decided that it was better to have too much thread than too little.
        The surgeon, however, took one look at the thread and asked her: "What did your grandmother tell you about measuring thread?" </p>
        <p>She was embarassed, but realized he was right. Long strands seem efficient, but they cause endless tangles and knots. It's a small thing, but I love thinking about the generations of grandmothers whose advice continues on in the hands of surgeons and seamstresses alike.</p>

        <h2>The House You Grew Up In</h2>
        <p class="credit">- Sarah Feeney,<em> Granddaughter</em></p>
        <p>On the day Grandma passed away my university held its convocation ceremony for incoming freshman. The main speaker began his address by asking us to close our eyes and envision the house we grew up in. My family lived in 6 different houses across 2 states by the time I was 12, so I have a hard time deciding which of those houses I really grew up in. As I sat there in the gymnasium with my eyes closed, I realized the home that I most associate with my childhood is Grandma and Grandpa’s house in Upland. It is so imprinted in my memory that the most frequent setting of my dreams is in that house. </p>
        <p>I loved the countless hours my sister and Jasen and I spent jumping off the diving board and putting on not-so-synchronized swimming shows in the pool, watching the collection of Disney movies in the family room, climbing eucalyptus trees in the back-backyard, or pounding the piano and dancing in the living room. I can still hear Johnny cat meowing from his perch on the window sill in the patio, clearly remember what the inside of the pantry smelled like (there were almost always Keebler fudge striped cookies in there), and envision the butterfly sticker on the sliding glass door (which I later realized must have been there to keep my mother from running through it). When I found out Grandma would be selling the Upland house I made a special trip just to be there one more time before it was passed on to another family. Even though by then I was 24 years old, I couldn’t help but do handstands in the pool and jump off the diving board.</p>

        <p>Years later during one of my Skype visits with Grandma, she told me about a house she lived in as a child. It was a farm house her family rented from someone who lived in the city. The owner gave them a good deal on rent in exchange for keeping up the place (of course getting a good deal would be a detail Grandma would be sure to share). The gardens provided fresh food even though money was tight during the depression, and while they didn’t have running water, they did have plumbing. Her family was lucky to have found this place after their own house burned down. Grandma described what it was like when her family had to quickly evacuate their burning home – each child was instructed to grab something and go. She laughed as she said her brother Lou grabbed a stick of butter.</p>
        <p>I admire my Grandma for many things – her service to our country during WWII, her career as a nurse, earning her bachelor’s degree in her 40s, her work with the Red Cross. But I think all these accomplishments are secondary to the impact she had as a mother of 6, grandmother to 10, and great-grandmother to 3. The work parents do to raise children and make a home for their families doesn’t earn any medals; yet the day-to-day tasks involved in meeting children’s needs and guiding them through life require not only selflessness, patience, physical endurance, and a sharp mind, but also creativity and a good sense of humor. Grandma had all of those qualities in abundance. I wasn’t around to experience the childhood my mother and her siblings had, but I know my childhood was richer and fuller because of the way she raised my mother and everything she did to make the Upland house a kid’s paradise.</p>

        <h2>Julia's Bustin' Out</h2>
        <p>According to grandma, the uniforms given to navy nurses were very fashionable but also deliberately loose so as to conceal distracting bustlines. However, on certain women (grandma included) the extra roomy top served to emphasize their curves rather than hide them. The sailors in her ward were very appreciative of this fact, and even sang a short riff on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0I-790dGx-o">show tune</a> when they saw her walk in: <em>"Ju-lia's bustin' out all ooooverrrr~!"</em></p>

        <h2>My Gramma</h2>
        <p> She could find the missed stitch and fix it without making you feel foolish. She could make the act of waving goodbye hilarious and regal at the same time. She tamed the most frightened of feral animals, diagnosed upset stomachs from hundreds of miles away, and made any day feel like a birthday by virtue of a chocolate cake. </p>
        <p>She rescued me, and a garden snake, with a pair of hot-dog tongs. Her house always smelled faintly of lemons, beach towels, and small beloved animals. She didn't mind if I played chopsticks on her piano.</p>
        <p> She made small blue pebbles seem rare and precious, for the simple reason that <em>I</em> had picked them out, just for her.</p>
